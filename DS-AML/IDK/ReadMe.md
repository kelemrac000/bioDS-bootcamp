Questions
1)	Define Correlation. Please cite any reference you may use. This can be as simple as copy and pasting a URL.
Correlation is basically a connection or a relationship between two or more things. In R, correlation is used to show a relationship between the data its given. For example when one variable increases and the other increases as well, then these two variables are said to be positively correlated. To use the correlation function just simply input cor()

2)	What is a correlation matrix? Why is the diagonal on the correlation matrix always 1.0? Please cite any reference you may use.
A correlation matrix basically sees into the correlation between multiple variables to give you a table containing the correlation coefficients between each variable and the others.

3)	Would you expect the down-syndrome (DS) AMLs to correlate more to other DS-AMLs or to the other M7 (megakaryocytic) AMLs? Why?
I would think that the the DS AML patients would correlate more to the other DS-AMLâ€™s as they both have DS-AML but I could be proven wrong with data counter proving my hypothesis.



4)	Define megakaryocytic AML.  Please cite any reference you may use.
Megakaryocytic AML are rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from primitive megakaryoblasts. Megakaryoblasts are a precursor cell to a promegakaryocyte, which in turn becomes a megakaryocytes, large bone marrow cell, during hematopoiesis.
